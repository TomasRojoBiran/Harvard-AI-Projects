Documentation
This project uses a set of traffic images to train the AI model. Due to the size of the dataset, the images are not included in this repository.

In the load_data function i used os to get to the paths of the labels and images and then i used the cv2 library to read the images, resize them and label them.

Then in the get_model function i just used what we have learned in the lecture and just changed some parameters to be the ones asked in the specifications.
