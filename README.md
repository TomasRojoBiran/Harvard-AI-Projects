# Harvard Artificial Intelligence Projects

Welcome to my collection of AI projects from the Harvard Artificial Intelligence with Python course. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in various AI concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques, showcasing practical applications of artificial intelligence using popular libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and TensorFlow.

## Overview

This repository contains 12 projects, each focusing on different aspects of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, natural language processing, search algorithms, and more. Below is a brief description of each project and the AI concepts it explores.

## Projects

1. **Attention**: Implementation of an attention mechanism to enhance model performance in various tasks, such as text generation and translation.

2. **Crossword**: A backtracking algorithm to solve crossword puzzles, demonstrating constraint satisfaction problems (CSP).

3. **Degrees**: Uses breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path (degrees of separation) between actors in the IMDB dataset.

4. **Heredity**: Bayesian network implementation to predict the likelihood of a person having a genetic trait based on family history.

5. **Knights**: A logic-based puzzle solver using propositional logic to solve the "Knights and Knaves" puzzle.

6. **Minesweeper**: An AI agent that plays Minesweeper using probabilistic reasoning and logical inference.

7. **Nim**: Implementation of a Q-learning agent that learns to play the game of Nim through reinforcement learning.

8. **PageRank**: Simulation of the PageRank algorithm, the foundation of Google's search engine ranking system, using random walk and matrix factorization methods.

9. **Parser**: A natural language processing (NLP) parser using context-free grammars to parse and understand sentence structures.

10. **Shopping**: A machine learning model that predicts customer shopping behavior, including classification tasks to identify potential buyers.

11. **TicTacToe**: Implementation of a minimax algorithm for playing Tic-Tac-Toe, ensuring the AI plays optimally against human opponents.

12. **Traffic**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to recognize and classify traffic signs from images using TensorFlow and Keras.
